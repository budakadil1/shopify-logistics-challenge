### Hello, this is my submission for the Shopify Backend Developer Internship Challenge.

## The website is currently deployed at: https://amazinglogistics.herokuapp.com/inventory/



## It can also be set-up as such: 
- Clone the repository
- Install all packages within requirements.txt using `pip install requirements.txt` (Python needs to be installed)

- Run Django server: `python manage.py runserver`

Voila, the website is now up. Please navigate to `localhost:8000/inventory`.


## How to use
Add Warehouse and Add Inventory buttons are at the top right.
Edit Inventory and Delete Inventory buttons will appear under each inventory.

Here is the tech I've used in completing this challenge:
- Django
